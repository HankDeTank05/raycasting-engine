# Pycasting Engine
The Pycasting Engine (Python + Raycasting Engine) allows you to make simple first-person shooter games in the vein of Wolfenstein 3D.

## Features
- Set the player movement and rotation speeds to your liking
- Allow for mouse+keyboard controls, or the classic keyboard-only controls
- Choose how the floor, ceiling, and walls look: use solid colors or textures
- Create a HUD with a customizable minimap, an ammo indicator, radar system, and more
- Add warp points to and from maps at specific locations
- Procedurally generate mazes to be used as maps in your game
- Scatter collectibles, power-ups, enemies, and other level elements throughout the map, either randomly or where you choose
- Allow for players to save their progress and custom settings

## features to add
- (DONE) ability to render textured images, in addition to untextured
- (DONE) add a way to procedurally generate mazes and use them as game maps
- (DONE) functional minimap
  - (DONE) revealing minimap based on what the player has seen
- ability to render pits in the floor
- ability to render walls of a different height
- ability for player to look up and down
- "jump" functionality
- add a multi-zone map (walking to a certain spot on the map loads a different "area")

## goals for this engine
(in no particular order)
- make and release a game using the engine
- learn game engine programming using it
- have fun coding (in Python or any language)
