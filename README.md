# raycasting-engine
my custom raycasting engine made in python

## libraries
- arcade (https://arcade.academy/)
- numpy (not a lot yet)

## credits
I used this tutorial - was incredibly helpful, despite being written in C++, which I know practically nothing about. Very helpful!

## features to add
- ability to render textured images, in addition to untextured
- add a way to procedurally generate mazes and use them as game maps
- functional minimap
  - revealing minimap based on what the player has seen
- ability to render pits in the floor
- ability to render walls of a different height
- ability for player to look up and down
- "jump" functionality
- add a multi-zone map (walking to a certain spot on the map loads a different "area")

## goals for this engine
(in no particular order)
- make and release a game using the engine
- learn game engine programming using it
- have fun coding (in Python or any language)

Thanks for checking out my dinky little Python passion project!
