# raycasting-engine
my custom raycasting engine made in python

## libraries
- arcade (https://arcade.academy/)
- numpy (not a lot yet, more coming hopefully)

## credits
I used this tutorial - was incredibly helpful, despite being written in C++, which I know practically nothing about. Very helpful!

## goals for this engine
(in no particular order)
- optimize the code to run at higher quality with target fps of 30 (if 60 is possible, that's my next target)
- add texture functionality to it
- make and release a game using the engine
- learn game engine programming using it
- have fun coding (in Python or any language)

Thanks for checking out my dinky little Python passion project!
